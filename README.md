# RL-RoadMap
My RL studies, codes and plans. I might be missing out some of the resources I liked throughout my studies since I started recording after sometime, but I will try to add them as (if) I see them again.

## Useful Resources (Used)

### General

- Amazing summary of all RL: [LilianWeng - A (Long) Peek into Reinforcement Learning](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/02/19/a-long-peek-into-reinforcement-learning.html)

### Tabular Methods

### Function Approximation Methods

#### Policy Gradients

- Really nice from scratch implementation with theory for policy gradients: [Janis Klaise - Reinforcement learning with policy gradients in pure Python](https://www.janisklaise.com/post/rl-policy-gradients/#appendix-a). Best thing about this is that, it doesn't use Neural Networks, which blurs a lot of intuituion out of using policy gradient, so it focuses only on Policy gradient while using only a simple logistic regression.
- Policy Gradient implementation (Not thorough for explanation part, just the code is nice) with softmax policy: [Quantam - Policy Gradients from Scratch with Python](http://quant.am/cs/2017/08/07/policy-gradients/)
- Most popular policy gradient algorithms summarized in a single post: [LilianWeng - Policy Gradient Algorithms](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/04/08/policy-gradient-algorithms.html)
